# LLM-based formalization approach
This directory contains resources needed for the LLM-based requirements formalization approach. 

## Files:
* `llm-prompts.docx` contains the various prompts used for the LLM-based formalization approach. 
* `AlloyStatementExtractor.py` contains the program that parses an LLM's (natural language) output to extract formal Alloy statements from the LLM-formalized requirements.
* `AlloyCriteriaGenerator.py` contains the program that generates input to an Alloy `run{}` statement when given truth values for each desired Alloy statement. This generates a set of constraints with which an Alloy model can be run and checked. 

### Notes: 
- Each of these files contains instructions for use within.
- After using the LLM with prompt engineering on the natural language security requirements, `AlloyStatementExtractor.py` should be used first to parse the LLM's output. Then, `AlloyCriteriaGenerator.py` can be used to generate an Alloy `run{}` statement.
- The `run{}` criteria generated by `AlloyCriteriaGenerator.py` may be input into `../Formally-Modeled-CWE/Alloy-CWE-model.als` to discover weaknesses within the initial requirements.
